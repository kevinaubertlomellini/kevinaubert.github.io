I am a second-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of New Mexico working under the supervision of [Prof. Rafael Fierro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7RhPnIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [MARHES](https://marhes.unm.edu) (Multi-Agent, Robotics, and Heterogeneous Systems) and [AgMan](https://agile-mfg.unm.edu) (Agile Manufacturing) laboratories.

I have a deep passion for motor sports and robotics. I have hands-on experience in high-profile competitions like Formula SAE and Shell Eco-Marathon, as well as advanced robotics projects involving UAVs as part of my research assistantship. I have strong technical expertise in Python, C++, MATLAB, Simulink, ROS, and Autodesk Inventor, with a focus on systems control and autonomous robotics systems.
