I am a second-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of New Mexico working under the supervision of Professor [Rafael Fierro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7RhPnIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [MARHES](https://marhes.unm.edu) (Multi-Agent, Robotics, and Heterogeneous Systems Lab) and [AgMan](https://agile-mfg.unm.edu) (Agile Manufacturing) laboratories. 

, with a deep passion for motor sports and robotics. I have hands-on experience in high-profile competitions like Formula SAE and Shell Eco-Marathon, as well as advanced robotics projects involving UAVs as part of my research assistantship. I have strong technical expertise in Python, C++, MATLAB, Simulink, ROS, and Autodesk Inventor, with a focus on systems control and autonomous robotics systems
[subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
