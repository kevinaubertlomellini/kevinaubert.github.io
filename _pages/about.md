I am a second-year Master's student in Electrical Engineering at the University of New Mexico, working under the supervision of [Prof. Rafael Fierro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I7RhPnIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [MARHES](https://marhes.unm.edu) (Multi-Agent, Robotics, and Heterogeneous Systems) and [AgMan](https://agile-mfg.unm.edu) (Agile Manufacturing) laboratories. Adittionally, I am part of the [UNM VolCAN Project](https://volcan.cs.unm.edu/),directed by [Prof. Melanie Moses](https://moseslab.cs.unm.edu/), where I develop, simulate, and test drone-platforms for data collection from active volcanoes.

I am deeply passionate about motorsports and robotics, with extensive hands-on experience in high-profile competitions such as Formula SAE and the Shell Eco-Marathon. My work spans advanced robotics projects involving UAVs as part of my research assistantship, where I specialize in systems control and autonomous robotics. I am highly skilled in programming languages like Python and C++, as well as engineering tools including MATLAB, Simulink, ROS2, and Autodesk Inventor.
