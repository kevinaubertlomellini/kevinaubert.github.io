I am currently a Master's student at University of Alberta working with Professor [Ehsan Hashemi](https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/networked-optimization-diagnos/about-us) as part of the [NODE Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/ehsan-hashemi-uwaterloo/home). My research intends to develop *reliable autonomous navigation systems* for *adversarial scenarios* (dynamic surrondings, light conditions and weather) and lies as a mixture of **SLAM**, **Graph Optimization**, **Deep Learning (DL)** and **State Estimation**. I started at NODE Lab as visiting scholar in 2023, supported by the [ELAP](https://www.educanada.ca/scholarships-bourses/can/institutions/elap-pfla.aspx?lang=eng) scholarship granted by Canadian government. 

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in robotics from the Universidad de Ingenieria y Tecnologia, Lima, Peru in 2023. My thesis was focused on *electroencephalography (EEG) decoding* for stimulus prediction through a **Transformer DNN** fused with **Interval Fuzzy Type-2 (IFT2)** units that can handle uncertainties and improve predictions, and it was supervised by Professor [Christian Flores](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kHwwJn4AAAAJ&hl=pt-BR)
